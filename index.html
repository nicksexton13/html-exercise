      <h2>Cities I Have Lived In</h2>
        <p>I was born in Charlotte, so that is how I lived there. I was told to move to Melbourne by Uncle Sam, so that is how I found my second home.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Charlotte <span>This city is on the list because I was born in it.</span></li>
          <li>Melbourne <span>This city is on the list because Uncle Sam says so.</span></li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Cities I Want to Visit</h2>
        <p>I would like to visit Denver because I love the mountains. LA is a culture hub of America, and I would like to experience some of the most diverse cultures in the world. Finally, NYC is a place I have always wanted to visit because of the variety of attractions, including sporting events.</p>
